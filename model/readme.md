# ${\color{lightblue} Model}$


The Model is developed using Convolutional Neural Network and is trained using Transfer learning where a pre-trained model is taken with the feature vector and the
softmax hidden layer removed. Then it is trained as per our desire to classify the 5 varieties of flowers. The below table gives the description of all the notebooks
developed in the project.
