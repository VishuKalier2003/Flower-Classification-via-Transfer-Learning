# ${\color{lightblue} Code \space Snippets}$

This folder provides a few code snippets which are used or are important for the insights of the project. If you want to replicate the entire project I would recommend
having a look at all the notebooks provided in the <b><i> Model </i></b> folder. This folder is mostly for snippets and for someone who wants to get a quick overview of
the working of the project and the approach.
